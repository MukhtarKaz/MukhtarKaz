I am a software engineer with a background in the nuclear power industry and geology. Studying new languages, exploring the latest technologies, and fishing along the river always gives me a sense of joy and pushes me forward.

My way to software development began when I was working in Kazakhstan, where I started learning programming at the local coding school. In 2019, to get experience and a comprehensive education I moved to Tokyo and joined the Immersive Program at Code Chrysalis, a Coding Bootcamp. Since then, I have built various full-stack applications using Express, Flask, Flutter, and React.

Currently, I am living in Tokyo. :sushi:

Strong: JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL, Knex, Express, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, Git.

Experienced: Dart/Flutter, Python/Flask, Firebase, Redux, Vue.js, Heroku
